Package OTBR for OpenWRT
====================

The OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully writable filesystem with package management.

OpenWRT use opkg to manage its packages, and this Makefile is to help package our project into .ipk and then can install on OpenWRT.

make menuconfig

# in "Network" column, select "openthread" option
make menuconfig
# package the project
make package/openthread/compile
# the .ipk file will be in ./bin/packages/mips_24kc/otbrpackage/openthread_xxx.ipk
# copy the .ipk file into OpenWRT device, and install
opkg install openthread_xxx.ipk
